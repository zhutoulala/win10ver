check which Windows 10 is running

I always have trouble to correlate the Windows 10 and its `Redstone` code name, so I created this tiny tool to help track the current Windows 10 Redstone code name and version that I am running.

```
C:\Users\peter\github\win10ver\src\Release>win10ver.exe
Windows 10 Redstone 4, Version: 1803, Release Date: April 30, 2018.
```
